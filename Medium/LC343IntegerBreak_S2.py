The key for this problem is that we need to break the number to 2s, 3s and 4s.
First we need to know a fact that,if a,b > 3, |a-b| <= 1, then a*b>=a+b.

So, if n = a + b, a = a1+a2, b=b1+b2, we should break n to a1+a2+b1+b2, |a1-a2|<1 and |b1-b2|<1 instead of a + b, because a1*a2>a, b1*b2>b. However, we shall stop when we get a 3 or 2, so what we shall do is to find the list of 3 and 2.

You may have noticed why the 4 appeared. 'Cause if we break 4, we get 2+2, and 2+2 = 2*2, so it's the same with the condition that we get two 2.
