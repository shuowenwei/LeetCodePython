Deal with difficult people: 
- why difficult? insecurity, low self-esteem and fear, boredom, power, lack awareness 
- temporarily or chronically? 
- find common interests/topics, establish a personal connection 
- Use“I”phrases (instead of you) 
- Listen and observe

self-introduction: 
- building end-to-end ML solutions, not just the model part
-  

1. Funding Portal R&D - image similarity - pixel-to-pixel comparison vs image embedding via ResNet50 
2. corpus of evidence - 
3. A tester, half of his time was for our team and half of his time was for another team, slowness is blocking/delaying the release schedule 
4. Createathon/Hackathon 
   - Won the category, 1st place of 17 teams, but din't get the grand prize in the first year, presentation is more important than technical details of 
   - my manager, who was in the audience, told me to get the main point out is more important than explaining tech details 
   - know your audience  -  critical feedback 
   
   - regularization vs regulation
   - transformer/bert vs 
5. hired the best - interview new graduates, ask the hard questions and stardard coding questions 
   - biweekly study and presentation groups 
   - always learn new things 
   - don't repeat the same work too many times 
6. insist on parallel processing and scheduled jobs 
7. doc similiarity in WebADV model 2, using BERT and encoding pages of docs for similiarity
8. find anormlies in flow logs data, work with network team, cyber security data injection team
9. newly promoted engineer managers who are micro-manageing is very difficult to work with.
10. Karen used to message me at 11pm
11. deploying HHRv5 model, due to python 
12. HHRv5 model, deep learning vs random forest, how to handle conflict of interests
