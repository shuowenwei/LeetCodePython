Deal with difficult people: 
- why difficult? insecurity, low self-esteem and fear, boredom, power, lack awareness 
- temporarily or chronically? 
- find common interests/topics, establish a personal connection 
- Use“I”phrases (instead of you) 
- Listen and observe


1. Funding Portal R&D - image similarity - pixel-to-pixel comparison vs image embedding via ResNet50 
2. corpus of evidence - 
3. A tester, half of his time was for our team and half of his time was for another team, slowness is blocking/delaying the release schedule 
4. Createathon/Hackathon 
   - Won the category, 1st place of 17 teams, but din't get the grand prize in the first year, presentation is more important than technical details of
