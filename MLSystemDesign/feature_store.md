Feature stores make it easy to:

- Productionize new features without extensive engineering support
- Automate feature computation, backfills, and logging
- Share and reuse feature pipelines across teams
- Track feature versions, lineage, and metadata
- Achieve consistency between training and serving data
- Monitor the health of feature pipelines in production

Feature stores aim to solve the full set of data management problems encountered when building and operating operational ML applications.

A feature store is an ML-specific data system that:

- Runs data pipelines that transform raw data into feature values
- Stores and manages the feature data itself, and
- Serves feature data consistently for training and inference purposes
