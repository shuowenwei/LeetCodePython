Hello? 

Webpage about Event (HTML) -> event name, location and start_time. 

predictions: 
{ HTML
event name: celebration of new year
location: san fransico, xx
start time: Jan 1st, 2022 
} 

Label –>
Feature extractions: 

HTML: images, text, text_language, number_comments, hyperlinks to other pages, creation time. 

CV_mmodel(image) – e.g ResNet50 
Langurage_mmodel(text) - e.g. Bert
Number_comments - continuous variable 
text_language - categorical variable - need a embedding 

[cv_vector] + [lm_vector] + [continuous] + [categorical] = concat together -> linear_layer -> linear_layer -> .. -> linear_layer -> [1…. .0.5] 

Language Generation Model (latent vector) -> 1 -> 4 -> 8 -> … -> ending_token 

1 to many RNN (LSTM) 

reverse_embedding: [1,4,8,2,9, …, ending_token] -> [celebration of new year, … Jan 1st, 2020]

Ending_token belongs (2022, some date time)

label: event_name + locatin + start_time 
label [1 2 3 5 7]
